Easily insert <a href="https://materialdesignicons.com/">Material Design Icons</a> (MDI) into your code with these SVG snippets. Just start by typing `svg-mdi-[name]`.

## Features

These snippets are set up to work with `html`, `javascript`, `react`, `vue`, `svelte`, `xml` and `razor`.

All icons are from the [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com) set and optimized using <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a>.

## Misc

The extension version is matched to MDI itself for easier identification. If you should find that an icon is missing, please wait for the extension to be updated. I will do my best to keep in sync with MDI.
